# Project 6 - OLAP Analysis - Total Customer Purchases by Product

## Methods and Introduction
**Question:** How many products is each customer purchasing? Can we find out how many of each product is being purchased in the process?\
\
**Purpose:** This could be an entry-level analysis to understanding a store's stock levels and what a customer in this store finds valuable.

## Data
In previous projects, we have prepared a data warehouse and a star/relational schema. I will be using this data warehouse for my analysis. You can find this data [here](link to prepared folder). This data warehouse is repeatable in us being able to update our raw data files (found [here](link to raw data)), so the data can be re-cleaned and standardized before entering the data warehouse.

## Tools I Used
In previous projects (P3-P5) I used much of Python and SQL, but now we will be using PowerBI as we have implemented the relational warehouse last project into the PowerBI system.
